# Album Art Display

Displays my favorite album art covers -- Similar to how Google's ChromeCast diplays different images, or Samsung's Frame TV cycles through art. As a secondary feature it also acts as it's own Spotify player. I like to think
of this feature as a jukebox. Perfect for small parties. Currently it's mostly structured but there is some spaghetti code that I need to address.
